# Conference & expense claims

These are some basic instructions to guide you through the process. 

1. Get a speedcode from Ali
2. Before conference, if you need a cash advance, create one, making sure to include breakdown of cost in the Notes section of form (note: do not need receipts)
3. Attend conference
4. Follow instructions below to create an expense report
5. If you had a cash advance, apply it to your expense claim
6. Print out copy of the claim report, attach all hard-copy & printed receipts
7. If your speedcode is MB*, then hard-copy claims go to Faye Carr, Medical Biophysics, MSB 4th floor (MSB 407)
8. If your speedcode is RT*, then hard-copy claims go to Janice Koenig, RRI (1st floor, past IT centre)

## Notes:

* You can use meal per-diem rates, but only for meals where the conference did not provide a meal (the admin staff will check against the conference program!)
* Attach the conference program if possible
* In the notes section, please include what your role is (grad student, post-doc etc..) and your relationship with me (e.g. Supervisor: Ali Khan)
