## Lab Communication

Slack is a team messaging environment and is now the preferred mode of online communication (rather than e-mail) for both collaborative and individual messaging. Apps exist for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows (not linux, but browser version works great!). Our team can be found on khanlab.slack.com.  If you are not yet on Slack, ask the administrator (alik@robarts.ca) for an invite.

Every week, you will need to send your signed timesheet to Rebecca Nash. This can be done by e-mail (rnash@robarts.ca) if Adobe Reader is used to provide digital signatures.  Otherwise, these can be printed and signed.
