For a list of available datasets see http://datasets.datalad.org Datalad datasets are git repositories that you can download, where the large files are symlink placeholders until you use the datalad get command on them to download the full file. Getting started with datalad: Install datalad python package: pip install --user --upgrade datalad Note: there is a singularity container for datalad available, but it had network issues when I tried it.. (AK) Install git-annex: See instructions here: http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/ If on graham, the linux standalone tarfile is shared, so just need to add this to your .bashrc: PATH=/project/6007967/software/git-annex.linux:$PATH Try it out, get a dataset: This command will get the an openneuro datalad dataset (won't download the large files yet): datalad install ///openfmri/ds000001 You will see all the files there, but the large ones will be symlinks if you ls -l . To get the files, use datalad get <filename/folder> : datalad get ds000001 or to get the files when you install, can use: dataset (won't download the large files yet): datalad install -g ///openfmri/ds000001 Jupyter Notebooks on Graham This documentation is for setting up an environment for Jupyter notebooks. It should be noted certain packages have dropped Python 2 support and may require installation of prior module versions. Portions of this documentation has been adapted from Compute Canada documentation (https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Jupyter). This documentation provides the basics to set up a Jupyter environment. For more detailed installation, visit the Compute Canada documentation page. Installing Jupyter Lab (creating a virtual environment) Load the appropriate Python module (Python 2 or Python 3) and set up a virtual environment (see previous section). Install Jupyter & Jupyter lab to your virtual environment source ~/ENV/bin/activate pip install jupyter pip install jupyterlab Submit the job regularInteractive supports job submission for Jupyter sessions. Before submitting your job, ensure your virtual environment is activated. Submit your job using the optional flag corresponding to Jupyter! regularInteractive -j Connecting to Jupyter Notebook From Linux / MacOS Compute Canada recommends using the sshuttle Python package to create a tunnel between your compute and the compute cluster. On your computer, open a new terminal window and run the following to create the tunnel sshuttle --dns -Nr <user>@graham.computecanada.ca Then copy and paste the provided URL into your browser. An example URL may look like the following: http://cdr544.int.cedar.computecanada.ca:8888/?token=7ed7059fad64446f837567e3 From Windows A tunnel can be created from Windows via MobaXTerm. This method will also work from any Unix-based system. After submitting your Jupyter job, a URL similar to the one on the screen http://cdr544.int.cedar.computecanada.ca:8888/?token=7ed7059fad64446f837567e3 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 hostname:port token Open a second Terminal tab in MobaXTerm (Session 2).

It is important to make sure migrated folders do not have a large number of small files, since the total number of files is limited. With the new space being 600TB and 30M maximum files, a reasonable rule of thumb is that folders with >500 files where the average file size is <20mb should be stored inside a tar file instead. We have some new tools to assist with migration from the rrg-akhanf project space to ctb-akhanf . These are located in neuroglia-helpers. Here are step-by-step instructions for performing the migration on your project folder. If you are unsure about any step (especially steps 2-4), STOP and ask for help to avoid any potential loss of data! Step 1: Get usage stats First step is to determine which folders can be migrated as-is, and which sub-folders require cleaning up. The listusage tool determine the numbers of files and average file size in your folders. This tool prints to the screen (and to a csv file in /scratch/$USER/listusage/... ), containing these statistics. Run the tool (e.g. on your project folder) using: listusage /project/rrg-akhanf/$USER This command may take a few minutes for larger folders -- can run it without any arguments to see additional options. Feel free to share your listusage output with me (Ali), especially if you are unsure about the next steps, or identifying which folders need to be cleaned. Step 2: Remove any unneeded files The listusage output may reveal certain directories that have a high number of files that are no longer needed -- (e.g. outdated analyses, old job directories, etc..). Remove anything you do not need anymore. Do not remove folders with large number of files that you DO need to keep, these can be replaced with TAR archives in a subsequent step. Step 3: Move and symlink folders The moveandlink tool migrates folders, and leaves behind a symbolic link on the source project folder to ensure previous paths still function correctly (as long as the rrg-akhanf folder exists). Use the dry-run option when you first run the tool to ensure the appropriate actions are being taken. moveandlink -n /project/rrg-akhanf/$USER/some_project_folder By default, moveandlink will not migrate folders with av file size <20mb, but you can use the -f option to force the move. Make sure you proceed with the next step in this case. Note: The move operation will be nearly instantaneous, since the files are not physically being moved around (since ctb and rrg folders are still on the same filesystem), but changing the group permission may take some time (depending on number of files). You should see plenty of output on the screen while it is doing this ( changed group of ... ) Step 4: Tar folders with small files The archivefolders tool will automatically tar-up folders that are below the avg number of files cutoff, submitting batch jobs for each tar job. Similar to moveandlink , make sure you run with the dry-run option -n to evaluate the actions: archivefolders -n /project/rrg-akhanf/$USER/some_project_folder NOTE: this tool will not remove the folder, but instead rename (mv) it to *.ARCHIVED. This is to prevent potential data loss and to also give you an opportunity to easily revert. Once you are satisfied with the tarfile replacement, please remove the .ARCHIVED folders yourself. Making use of archived data in the future The best way to make use of data that has a large number of small files that exist in a tar file on project space, is to extract that folder on scratch, and work with it there. e.g. to extract to scratch: mkdir /scratch/$USER/some_project_folder tar -C /scratch/$USER/some_project_folder/ -xvf /project/ctb-akhanf/$USER/some_project_folder/name_of_tar_file.tar # FAQ Q1. I am getting a Disk Quota Exceeded error on /project space! A1: Files/folders on the /project space must have the group permission rrg-akhanf to make use of our allocation. Please see the section above to reset your group permissions on your files/foldlab Q2. Singularity images that use python running on graham use python dependencies from the .local directory in my home directory rather than using python dependencies from the image. A2 Python will automatically take dependencies from the .local directory and in order to work around this quirk we can create a new directory called fake_home with symlinks within it that call directories in our home directory (home/$USER) that we would actually like to use. In neuroglia-helpers/cfg/graham.cfg under singularity options add the flag --home followed by the path to the fake_home directory. Create fake home directory with sym_links. ```BASH cd ~ mkdir fake_home cd fake_home ln -s #repeat this for as many directories as you require 2. Open graham.cfg file and add --home flag to singularity opts with path to fake_home directory. Text after --home represents flag and path to be added to existing script BASH nano ~/neuroglia-helpers/cfg/graham.cfg Singularity options SINGULARITY_OPTS=\"-e -B /cvmfs:/cvmfs -B /project:/project -B /scratch:/scratch -B /localscratch:/localscratch --home /home/$USER/fake_home\" ```","title":"Getting started with Compute Canada"},{"location":"Compute%20Canada/#getting-started-with-compute-canada","text":"This document is designed to help new lab members get started with Compute Canada, and also as a reference to existing members.
